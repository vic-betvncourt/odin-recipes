            <li>&frac12; small red onion, sliced into petals</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine avocado, sour cream, mayonnaise, water, lime juice, 
                ranch seasoning, and salt in a food processor. Blend until smooth. 
                Refrigerate until ready to use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the chicken in a bowl. Add olive oil and fajita seasoning. 
                Toss until evenly combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare a grill over medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. 
                Add chicken and corn. Grill, turning once, until corn is tender and 
                chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 
                10 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the 
                center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a cutting board.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide romaine, tomatoes, black beans, and onions between two serving plates. 
                Cut corn off the cob; divide between the two plates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice chicken breast; divide between the 2 plates. Drizzle each salad with avocado dressing to serve.
            </li>
        </ol>
